Hey ðŸ‘‹ Happy to see you here! <br> 
I'm Alex, and I love crafting algorithmic, High-Frequency Trading Systems and blockchain stuff: research and algos, complex tokens/smart contracts, custom blockchains, and high-load backends.
Mostly Rust, TypeScript, Python, and Solidity. C++ (still). 2xMSc Applied Math and Stats. 

I occasionally post some quant/dev stuff on X as [crypt0grapher](https://x.com/7blockchains) and also maintain [Zero Lag Club Substack](https://zerolag.club) where I provide free education for developers on market microstructure.


Delivering advanced blockchain and trading systems.<be>

Among other things, I'm a huge fan of applied cryptography, Î» functional, :- logic programming, and FreeBSD!<br>
