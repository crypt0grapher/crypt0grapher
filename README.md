Hey ðŸ‘‹ happy to see you here! <br> 
I'm Alex loving to work on literally anything around DeFi: smart contracts, custom blockchains, React webapps, APIs, games, high-load backends. 
Mostly Typescript, Solidity, and Rust. Degrees in Applied Math and Stats help doing R&D in cryptography and tokenomics.<br>
Feel free to check out open-source code of [Decenralized Foundation](https://defo.app/) and [Safe Yields](https://safeyields.io/).

Among other things, I'm a huge fan of applied cryptography, Î» functional  and :- logic progamming, and FreeBSD!<br>

If you're looking to get done quickly some complex blockchain stuff or just collaborate on something don't hesitate to give me a shout! ðŸ¤³
You might want to ping me on [Telegram](https://t.me/+t_BYca-6g7c5Mjkx) or simply [schedule a call with me](https://calendly.com/crypt0grapher/30min).
