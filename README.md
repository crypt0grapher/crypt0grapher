Hey 👋 happy to see you here! <br> 
I'm Alex loving to work on literally anything around DeFi: smart contracts, custom blockchains, React webapps, APIs, games, high-load backends. 
Mostly Typescript, Solidity, and Rust. Degrees in Applied Math and Stats help doing R&D in cryptography and tokenomics.<br>

If you're looking to get done quickly some complex blockchain stuff or form a cooperation, don't hesitate to give me a shout! 🤳
You might want to find me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/W4GUCvag) or simply [schedule a call with me](https://calendly.com/crypt0grapher/30min).
