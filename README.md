Hey 👋 happy to see you here! <br> 
I'm Alex loving to work on literally anything around DeFi: smart contracts, custom blockchains, React webapps, APIs, games, high-load backends. 
Mostly Typescript, Solidity, and Rust. Degrees in Applied Math and Stats help doing R&D in cryptography and tokenomics.<br>
Freelancer, valuing my freedom a lot, and not into a permanent job. 

If you're looking to get done quickly complex stuff or form some cooperation, don't hesitate to give me a shout! 🤳
